I'm a passionate developer with an interest in various technologies and a love for coding. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

- **Name:** Gandharv Kulkarni
- **Username:** gandharvk422

## Skills

- **Languages:** Python, R, JavaScript, C++, SQL
- **Frameworks:** Bootstrap, Streamlit, Django

## Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:

1. **CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN:** This project was developed as a task assigned by SkyHighes Technologies. The main objective was to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. In addition to the model, I have developed a Streamlit web application named CIFARInsight - Decode Your Images to provide an interactive platform for users to upload images and receive predictions based on the trained model. This web application was created to enhance my resume and demonstrate my skills in deploying machine learning models.
2. **CRM SALES OPPORTUNITIES DASHBOARD:** This project provides a dashboard for tracking customer accounts, sales opportunities, and sales team performance. It supports data-driven decisions by displaying insights from CRM data in a structured format.
3. **GOOGLE STOCK PRICE PREDICTION:** Created an LSTM-based stock price prediction model in Python using Keras and TensorFlow. Improved model accuracy by 35% through feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization. Performed time series analysis on Google stock prices, using Pandas and Scikit-Learn, reducing processing time by 20%.
