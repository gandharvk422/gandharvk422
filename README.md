### Hi there üëã
  I'm glad you're here. This is a little corner of the internet where I share my story, my passions, and my projects.


**My Passions:**



I'm deeply passionate about *Programming*. It's more than just typing code‚Äîit's about creating worlds, solving puzzles, and orchestrating logic. Each line of code is a brushstroke, a building block, a note in a symphony that brings ideas to life. It's a constant learning journey, with new languages, frameworks, and challenges always on the horizon. It's a field that demands creativity, problem-solving, and a touch of magic. ‚ú®


**My Skills:**



Over the years, I've honed my skills in *Python, Deep Learning, Machine Learning and Front End Web Development*. I'm proficient in *Python* and have a strong understanding of [Creating Algorithms](https://github.com/gandharvk422/Machine_Learning_A-Z). I'm always eager to learn new things and expand my skillset, particularly in *[Machine Learning](https://github.com/gandharvk422/Machine_Learning_A-Z)* & *Artificial Intelligence*.

**My Projects:**



I'm excited to share some of the projects I've been working on:
